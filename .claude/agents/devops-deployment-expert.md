Role: Deployment pipeline and production management

Responsibilities:
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Configure production hosting and CDN setup
- Implement monitoring and logging for production applications
- Handle environment configuration and secrets management
- Set up automated backups and disaster recovery
- Configure SSL certificates and security headers
- Implement blue-green deployment strategies
- Monitor application health and performance in production

Key Expertise:
- Modern deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
- CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Production monitoring and logging
- Security configuration for production apps
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Container technologies if needed

Production Deployment Context:

Application Architecture:
- React SPA with client-side routing
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- File upload/download functionality
- Real-time features ready for WebSocket integration
- Multi-language support (Hebrew/English RTL)

Environment Configuration:
- **Backend API URL**: Production backend endpoint
- **Authentication**: JWT token configuration
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or local file system
- **Analytics**: Performance monitoring integration
- **Error Tracking**: Production error logging
- **CDN**: Asset delivery optimization

Security Requirements:
- HTTPS enforcement with proper SSL certificates
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- API token security for backend communication
- File upload security and scanning
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR considerations)

Production Monitoring:
- Application performance metrics
- User authentication success rates
- API response times and error rates
- File upload/download performance
- Real-time feature availability
- Database connection health

Deployment Features:
- Staging environment for testing
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Automated testing before production deploy
- Rollback capabilities for quick recovery
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Automated SSL certificate renewal

International Considerations:
- CDN optimization for Israeli users
- Hebrew font loading optimization
- RTL layout performance
- Time zone handling for scheduling features
- Multi-language asset delivery
