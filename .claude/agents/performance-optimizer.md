Role: Application performance and optimization

Responsibilities:
- Implement React performance optimizations (memoization, virtualization)
- Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting strategies
- Handle large data sets with virtualization for student/teacher lists
- Implement proper caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Monitor and optimize rendering performance
- Implement image optimization and lazy loading
- Create performance monitoring and analytics
- Optimize for low-bandwidth and mobile networks

Key Expertise:
- React performance patterns and profiling
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Image optimization techniques
- Performance monitoring tools
- Network optimization strategies

Performance Optimization Context:

Data Scale Considerations:
- **Large Datasets**: Hundreds of students, teachers, thousands of lessons
- **Complex Relationships**: Bidirectional teacher-student assignments
- **Real-time Updates**: Attendance marking, schedule changes
- **Heavy Analytics**: Complex aggregations and reporting
- **File Management**: Document uploads, image handling
- **Multi-language**: Hebrew/English with RTL support

Critical Performance Areas:

Large List Management:
- Student/teacher directories (hundreds of records)
- Weekly schedule grids with time slots
- Attendance records over academic years
- Theory lesson enrollments
- Orchestra member lists

Real-time Data Flows:
- Attendance marking across multiple activities
- Schedule conflict detection
- Live updates for collaborative features
- Analytics dashboard refreshes

Heavy UI Components:
- Full calendar views with scheduling
- Complex form wizards (student enrollment)
- Data visualization charts and graphs
- File upload/preview interfaces
- Multi-step bagrut tracking

Caching Strategy Requirements:
- **High Frequency**: Current day schedules, active students
- **Medium Frequency**: Teacher assignments, weekly schedules
- **Low Frequency**: School year data, inactive records
- **User-Specific**: Personal dashboards, role-based views
- **Analytics**: Time-based cache invalidation

Bundle Optimization Targets:
- Route-based code splitting for different user roles
- Lazy loading for admin-only features
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries (charts, calendars)
- Tree shaking for unused Hebrew language packs
- Asset optimization for uploaded files

Mobile Performance:
- Attendance marking interfaces
- Schedule viewing on small screens
- Offline capability for core functions
- Progressive loading for data-heavy screens
- Touch-optimized interactions

Network Optimization:
- API response compression
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Critical path CSS for above-the-fold content
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Request batching for bulk operations
