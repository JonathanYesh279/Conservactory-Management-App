Student Management Backend API:

Core Student Operations:
```typescript
// Student listing with advanced filtering
GET /api/student
Query Params:
- name: string (filter by student name)
- instrument: string (filter by instrument)
- stage: string (filter by current stage)
- isActive: boolean (active/inactive students)
- showInActive: boolean (include inactive, default: false)

Response: Student[] with:
- _id, personalInfo, academicInfo, isActive, teacherAssignments

// Individual student details
GET /api/student/:id
Response: Complete student object with all nested data

// Create new student
POST /api/student
Middleware: validateTeacherAssignmentsMiddleware
Auto-behaviors:
- Sets primary instrument if none specified
- Auto-enrolls in current school year
- Syncs teacher records bidirectionally

// Update student
PUT /api/student/:id
Authorization: Teachers can only update their own students (unless admin)
Automatic teacher-student relationship sync
Student Data Structure:
typescriptinterface Student {
  _id: string;
  personalInfo: {
    fullName: string; // Required
    email?: string;
    phone?: string;
    address?: string;
    dateOfBirth?: Date;
    idNumber?: string; // Unique
  };
  parentsInfo: {
    parent1?: { name: string; phone: string; email: string; };
    parent2?: { name: string; phone: string; email: string; };
  };
  academicInfo: {
    instrumentProgress: Array<{
      instrumentName: string;
      isPrimary: boolean;
      startDate: Date;
      currentStage: string;
      stageTests: TestResult[];
      technicalTests: TestResult[];
    }>;
  };
  teacherAssignments: Array<{
    teacherId: string;
    day: string;
    time: string; // HH:MM format
    duration: number; // minutes
    location: string;
    isActive: boolean;
  }>;
  enrollments: {
    schoolYears: Array<{
      schoolYearId: string;
      isActive: boolean;
    }>;
  };
  orchestraIds: string[];
  bagrutId?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}
Progress Testing System:
typescript// Update test results
PUT /api/student/:id/test
Request: {
  instrumentName: string;
  testType: 'stageTest' | 'technicalTest';
  status: 'לא נבחן' | 'עבר/ה' | 'לא עבר/ה' | 'עבר/ה בהצטיינות' | 'עבר/ה בהצטיינות יתרה';
}

// Hebrew Status Values:
- 'לא נבחן' (Not tested)
- 'עבר/ה' (Passed)
- 'לא עבר/ה' (Failed)
- 'עבר/ה בהצטיינות' (Passed with distinction)
- 'עבר/ה בהצטיינות יתרה' (Passed with high distinction)
Attendance Integration:
typescript// Student attendance statistics
GET /api/student/:studentId/private-lesson-attendance
Response: Attendance statistics from all lessons

// Complete attendance history
GET /api/student/:studentId/attendance-history
Response: Historical records across all activities

// Analytics integration
GET /api/analytics/students/:studentId/attendance
Query Params:
- includePrivateLessons, includeTheory, includeRehearsal, includeOrchestra
- startDate, endDate for filtering
- compareWithPrevious for trend analysis
Key Features to Implement:

Advanced Student Search: Multi-field filtering with real-time results
Progress Visualization: Charts showing advancement through stages
Attendance Dashboard: Calendar view with status indicators
Teacher Assignment: Drag-and-drop scheduling interface
Document Management: File upload for student records
Parent Portal: Communication and progress viewing
Mobile Attendance: Quick check-in for teachers
Bulk Operations: Import/export student data
Academic Reports: Progress summaries and transcripts

Special Behaviors:

Soft delete preserves data but deactivates relationships
Teacher assignments trigger bidirectional sync
Primary instrument auto-setting
Current school year auto-enrollment
Validation middleware ensures data integrity
