# Sidebar Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Z-Index Hierarchy
- **Fixed**: Adjusted z-index values to prevent overlapping
  - Sidebar: z-[55]
  - Hamburger/Toggle buttons: z-[60]
  - Header: z-[45]
  - Backdrop: z-[50]
  - Modals: z-[100]

### 2. Conditional Rendering Logic
- **Fixed**: Layout.tsx line 15 - Changed `!user` to `user &&` to properly check if user exists
- **Fixed**: Sidebar.tsx line 138 - Changed return `['admin']` to return `[]` when no user
- **Fixed**: Header.tsx line 18 - Changed `!user ||` to `user && (` for admin check
- **Fixed**: Header.tsx line 24 - Added proper user check for hasSidebar

### 3. Button Positioning
- **Fixed**: Mobile hamburger button position (top-[20px] right-4)
- **Fixed**: Desktop toggle button position (top-[20px] right-4)

Layout Debug: {
  hasUser: boolean,
  userRole: string,
  userRoles: array,
  shouldShowSidebar: boolean,
  isMobile: boolean,
  isDesktopOpen: boolean
}

// Sidebar.tsx logs:
Sidebar Debug: {
  hasUser: boolean,
  isLoading: boolean,
  userRoles: array,
  isAdmin: boolean,
  hasMultipleRoles: boolean,
  isMobile: boolean,
  isDesktopOpen: boolean,
  isOpen: boolean
}
```
